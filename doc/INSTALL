Installing eZ GPG extension
==============================================

1. Copy the package into the `extension' directory
   in the root of your eZ publish installation.

2. Unpack the files in the distribution. The command
   necessary is depends on the file you downloaded.
   [tar.gz]:
   $ tar -zxvf ezgpg-0_4_5.tar.gz
   [zip]:
   $ unzip ezgpg-0_4_5.tar.zip

3. We must now enable the extension in eZ publish.

   To do this edit site.ini.append(.php) in the folder
   root_of_ezpublish/settings. If this file does not exist;
   create it. Locate (or add) the block

   [ExtensionSettings] and add the line:
   ActiveExtensions[]=ezgpg

   If you run several sites using only one distribution
   and only some of the sites should use the extension,
   make the changes in the override file of that siteaccess.

   E.g root_of_ezpublish/settings/siteaccess/shop/site.ini.append(.php)
   But instead of using ActiveExtensions you must add these lines instead:

   [ExtensionSettings]
   ActiveAccessExtensions[]=ezgpg

4. We must now configuration eZ GPG

   You will need to install and edit the ezgpg.ini.append.php file.
   Customize the variables to meet your own needs, these are the two 
   required variables; GPGKeyring and KeyID. Alternately you may create
   an override copy of this file.

   If you run several sites using only one distribution
   and only some of the sites should use the extension,
   make the changes in the override file of that siteaccess.

   E.g root_of_ezpublish/settings/siteaccess/shop/ezgpg.ini.append(.php)
   But you will need to edit these lines:

   [GPGLocations]
   GPGBinary=/usr/bin/gpg
   # GPGKeyring=keyring
   GPGKeyring=/web/pro/example.com/.gpg
   GPGTempdir=/tmp

   [eZGPGSettings]
   KeyID=admin@example.com
   Key=admin@example.com
   Debug=false


   Note:
